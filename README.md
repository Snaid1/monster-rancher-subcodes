Archive of Monster Rancher Subcodes

This is my archive of monster rancher subcodes. It will contain all subcodes I can get to have them all in one place when I feel like playing a Monster Rancher game.
If you have subcodes I am missing please submit a pull request to add the subcode data to the repo.

# Special Thanks
Special Thanks to the following for their subcode data
* Corollax - The initial repo of subcode I forked off of
* Monster Rancher Metropolis - The Labratory had many subcode files. I do not have who originally posted them but I thank any who cotributed there who find their subcodes in this repo.
